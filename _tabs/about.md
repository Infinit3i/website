I am a Security Engineer.

I enjoy detection engineering and finding out how things tick. I have worked a long time to sharpen the spear to enable soc analysts and threat hunters to better find Hackers. Much of my work focuses on translating attacker behavior into detection logic across logs, telemetry, and security platforms for my fellow analysts.

I have a strong interest in **malware analysis** and I am actively learning **malware development** to better understand threats from the inside out. I am currently learning from Maldev Academy, Sektor 7 training and splunk eLearning courses. Learning how malware is built directly improves how I detect, monitor and analyze malware.

Some of my favorite projects have been [Detection-Wizard](https://github.com/Infinit3i/Detection-Wizard), [Defensive-Rules](https://github.com/Infinit3i/Defensive-Rules), [IOC-Detections](https://github.com/Infinit3i/IOC-Detections), [Hunt-AI](https://github.com/Infinit3i/hunt-ai).
