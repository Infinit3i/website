I completed the Splunk Core User certification on January 23, with only one day's notice. This was not because the exam was trivial in isolation, but because the material aligned directly with five years of experience as a Detection Engineer.

The certification focuses on foundational Splunk concepts, including basic architecture, search workflows, and SPL usage. Topics such as indexers, search heads, forwarders, fields, dashboards, alerts, and reports are central to the objectives. These are not abstract ideas for anyone working in detection. They are the mechanics of daily work.

From a detection engineer’s perspective, the learning curve is nonexistent. I write SPL intuitively and already understand fields, enrichment, and correlation. The exam merely certifies my grasp of Splunk terminology and interface—not analytical ability.

Preparation included a brief review of objectives and Splunk phrasing. The exam was completed and passed within a day.

This certification serves as a baseline credential that confirms operational literacy with Splunk. Its primary value for experienced engineers is as a formal validation of platform knowledge rather than as an indicator of detection expertise or professional growth.
