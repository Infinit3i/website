The Splunk Defense Analyst certification was a great cert for a Splunk SOC analyst learning how to better triage their environment. The focus was on using Splunk to triage and work through alerts and investigations. A major focus of the material was MITRE ATTACK, NIST, CIs 18, and Lockheed Martin Kill Chain, and how they should guide the detection strategy. Instead of treating alerts as isolated events, I learned how to map activity to attacker techniques and understand where an alert fits in the overall attack lifecycle.

This made investigations more structured and reduced guesswork when determining intent and severity. Alert triage was another key area. I spent a lot of time learning how to quickly evaluate alerts, determine what mattered, and decide when escalation was necessary. Understanding how to move from an alert to a meaningful investigation helped reinforce disciplined workflows and reduce wasted effort during busy shifts.

The course also covered different types of alerts, including notable events, and how the secondary index is used to build and track those alerts. Learning how alerts are generated, enriched, and stored gave me better insight into how analysts consume data and why some alerts provide more value than others. Reducing alert fatigue was a major takeaway. I learned the importance of removing low-value alerts and tuning detections that generate noise. Too many alerts dilute analyst focus and slow response. The material emphasized quality over quantity and reinforced that fewer high-confidence alerts lead to better outcomes.

Just as important was learning how to create more effective alerts that provide analysts with a clear direction to follow. Effective alerts should clearly answer basic questions upfront and direct analysts to the next investigative step. This mindset directly supports effective SOC operations and faster response times. One of the things I enjoyed most was learning how Splunk Enterprise Security enriches data and helps analysts connect the dots. Contextual enrichment, correlations, and risk-based insights made it easier to identify threats that would otherwise blend into normal activity. Overall, this certification strengthened how I design detections, tune alerts, and support analysts in finding real threats efficiently.

I also passed this course on February 9. This eLearning reinforced the proactive nature of threat hunting and how it differs from alert-driven detection. The focus was on identifying what detections may miss, understanding attacker behaviors outside established baselines, and applying a structured hunt methodology: prepare, execute, act, and capture knowledge. A key takeaway was learning the difference between hypothesis-driven hunts and baseline deviation hunts, and when each approach is appropriate. This course helped solidify a disciplined, repeatable hunting mindset that complements SOC detection and incident response workflows.
