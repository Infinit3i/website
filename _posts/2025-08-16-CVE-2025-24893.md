# [CVE-2025-24893](https://github.com/Infinit3i/CVE-2025-24893) — XWiki Groovy Macro RCE

CVE-2025-24893 is a remote code execution vulnerability affecting **XWiki**, caused by improper sandboxing when **Groovy macros are rendered asynchronously**. XWiki’s macro engine is designed to provide extensibility while maintaining execution boundaries, but those assumptions break down under asynchronous rendering conditions.

The vulnerability can be triggered through RSS-based `SolrSearch` endpoints, where attacker-controlled input is evaluated in a context that bypasses Groovy’s intended restrictions. This effectively converts a search and content-rendering feature into an execution surface, allowing arbitrary system commands to run under the XWiki service account. [^NIST]

This proof of concept demonstrates reliable exploitation by injecting Groovy payloads to execute commands directly or stage a full reverse shell. The tooling automates payload generation using `msfvenom`, hosts binaries over HTTP, and executes them through the vulnerable macro path. The exploit chain is intentionally kept clean and readable to make the execution flow easy to validate.

From a defensive standpoint, this vulnerability highlights the risks introduced by **macro engines, asynchronous execution, and search features intersecting without strict isolation**. It reinforces the need for strong sandbox enforcement, reduced macro privileges, and careful review of any feature that evaluates user-influenced content server-side.
