GMON was a very different experience compared to my previous certifications. After completing GCFA, I felt far more confident in my ability to learn and apply advanced material, so I approached GMON with a calm mindset. I was not chasing stress or pressure this time. My goal was simply to sharpen skills that directly supported my day to day work.

I completed GMON on April 11, 2025. The material felt approachable and practical, especially after the depth and intensity of GCFA. I was relaxed throughout the study process and focused more on understanding how continuous monitoring supports strong security operations rather than worrying about passing the exam.

GMON helped reinforce how a mature SOC should think about visibility, coverage, and signal quality. The certification emphasized what to monitor, why it matters, and how to design monitoring that actually helps analysts instead of overwhelming them. This aligned closely with how I already approach threat hunting and detection work.

Another important concept reinforced through monitoring and network visibility was understanding OpenAppID and why application level awareness matters. Knowing what traffic should exist on the network is just as important as detecting what should not. Being able to configure firewalls to explicitly allow only expected application traffic and block unexpected outbound connections reduces attacker freedom and limits command and control paths. Controlling egress traffic based on application behavior rather than ports alone strengthens security posture and forces malicious activity to stand out. Properly configured firewalls that restrict outbound traffic to known services make threat hunting more effective and reduce the attack surface across the environment.

A large takeaway from GMON was how infrastructure decisions directly impact detection outcomes. Logging strategy, telemetry placement, and data flow design all influence whether threats are detected early or missed entirely. The material helped validate many of the best practices I already used while also filling in gaps around monitoring strategy at scale.

From a detection engineering perspective, GMON strengthened how I think about building sustainable detections. Instead of focusing only on individual alerts, it reinforced the importance of consistent data sources, reliable baselines, and monitoring that evolves with the environment. This made my detection work more intentional and easier to maintain.

GMON also complemented my role as a security engineer by tying monitoring decisions back to operational reality. It reinforced the idea that good security infrastructure enables analysts to succeed rather than slowing them down. Monitoring should reduce uncertainty, not create noise.

Overall, GMON was less about pushing limits and more about refining fundamentals. I took it to deepen knowledge that directly supports my work in the SOC, threat hunting, and detection engineering. The certification complemented my experience well and strengthened how I design, monitor, and defend real environments every day.
