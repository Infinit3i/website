Between the end of March and July 2022, I spent nearly all of my free time on TryHackMe. I woke up every day itching for knowledge and the next thing I could gain from the labs. I would learn all the different labs, whether it was IT, the OSI model, networking, SOC work, detection, malware analysis, CTF, or anything else.

During this period, I completed **over 400 TryHackMe rooms and boxes**, covering a wide range of offensive and defensive security topics. At the time, I was ranked **in the top 300 users globally** on the platform.

The labs spanned networking, Linux and Windows internals, privilege escalation, Active Directory concepts, web exploitation, malware fundamentals, log analysis, and blue team detection workflows. Every single lab I did not understand fully, I would watch YouTube videos to better my abilities. TryHackMe helped me sharpen my abilities and gave me repetitions where I couldn’t have done it otherwise.

I genuinely enjoyed the process. The consistency, volume, and hands-on nature of the platform significantly accelerated my learning and reinforced habits that I still rely on today when approaching new tools, techniques, and environments.
