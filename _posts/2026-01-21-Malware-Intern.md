I had the opportunity to work directly with Cobalt Strike, which gave me firsthand exposure to how C2 frameworks operate. Seeing how operators interact with beacon payloads and post-exploitation workflows helped solidify how offensive tooling is actually used beyond theory. This experience directly improved how I think about detection and response.

In addition, I spent time writing C code and refining my understanding of data structures and algorithms. This forced me to think more deliberately about memory control, execution flow, and performance. Writing lower-level code sharpened my ability to reason about what software is actually doing at runtime rather than treating it as a black box.

I also learned to work within an agile development approach. I participated in planning, breaking work into small deliverables, and iterating quickly based on feedback. This changed how I think about security tooling by treating it as evolving software instead of one-off scripts.

Another major area of growth was static scanning and secure code review. I learned how to review programming code with a security mindset and how to perform SAST by building scanning workflows inside Docker. Creating and running these systems myself clarified how static analysis tools work and where their limitations are.

Finally, I worked on reverse engineering a FOSS tool to determine whether it exhibited beaconing behavior. Using FlareVM, I combined static and dynamic analysis to inspect execution behavior, network activity, and indicators. This reinforced how offensive and defensive skills converge and why strong analysis capabilities matter on both sides.
