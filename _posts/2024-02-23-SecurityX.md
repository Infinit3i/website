I completed SecurityX on February 23, 2024, and this exam was huge for me. This was the first certification where I put the full weight of everything I knew into preparation.

I focused entirely on the [exam objectives](https://www.comptia.org/en-us/certifications/securityx/) and made it a rule to ask why for every concept. If I did not understand something perfectly, I kept researching until I did. I listened to the [Jason Dion training videos](https://www.udemy.com/course/casp-plus/?srsltid=AfmBOor3DWAP8WD3dyRRuP23O3DTjz1SSWX7FAGCJAVICirlJa6TWy3M) anytime I was driving and watched each video three times to fully lock in the material. The first time I would listen at 2 tiems speed before reviewing any matierial. The second time after i reviewed the material i would watch at normal speed and revisit anything I have been struggling with on the tests. 

I revisited topics repeatedly until they became second nature. The final time I watched the videos I did not watch everyone. Only the sections I was struggling with were the ones I watched. As I got closer to the exam, especially in the final three months, I increased how often I took practice tests, completing each test five times to pressure test my understanding and decision making.

When I sat for the exam, it was the first time I genuinely thought I failed while taking it. Near the end, I was sweating, my heart was racing, and I felt the pressure of every question. When I finally submitted the exam, it felt like my chest dropped while waiting for the result.

When the screen showed that I **passed**, I could not believe it. I honestly thought I was dreaming. I asked the proctor to confirm that I had really passed, and she did. That moment hit harder than any certification before it.

SecurityX caught me off guard in the best way. It made me realize I could operate as a proper lead analyst. I felt confident translating technical findings to management in a way that addressed their concerns, while also guiding both junior and senior analysts and engineers with clarity. This certification did not just validate knowledge, it validated how I think, communicate, and lead.
