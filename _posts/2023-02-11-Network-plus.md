I prepared for the CompTIA Network+ by combining exam prep with a strong technical foundation I had just finished building. I completed the [Jason Dion Udemy Network+ course](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-network-n10-009-6-practice-exams-and-pbqs-set-1/?srsltid=AfmBOoqzLUaRdjYQW7Kj06F3mJyHaJHpnEL_uCRbgPmFWzGHa8KyKKfS) and took every pretest he provided. I didn't notice how much the tests helped me at first. I did some of the videos but I felt I had a good knowledge before taking my first certifaction.

I scheduled the exam 1 week out and treated preparation as focused validation rather than relearning from scratch. The Dion practice exams mapped closely to the official Network+ objectives (Networking Concepts, Infrastructure, Network Operations, Network Security, and Troubleshooting), which made it easy to measure readiness and close small gaps efficiently.

Just before starting Network+ prep, I graduated from a military schoolhouse where networking was drilled daily. We covered subnetting, subnet masks, IP addressing, and how data moves across networks. That directly aligned with Network+ objectives around IP addressing, routing fundamentals, and network architecture.

We also worked extensively with routers, switches, hubs, VLANs, default gateways, and device roles. Understanding how devices interconnect, how VLANs segment traffic, and how static versus dynamic configurations behave mapped cleanly to the Infrastructure and Network Operations domains of the exam.

Finally, we tied everything together by identifying what operates at OSI Layers 1, 2, and 3 and why that matters operationally and during troubleshooting. Between hands-on military training and targeted exam practice, Network+ felt like a confirmation of skills I already had. I took the exam on schedule and passed without issue because the objectives matched real experience, not memorization.
