When I started preparing for CompTIA CySA+, I quickly realized it was very similar to Security+, but with a stronger analytical and operational focus. The foundational concepts were familiar, but CySA+ required applying them in a way that reflected real defensive workflows rather than theory alone.

I studied for approximately one month and gave myself two weeks of dedicated, focused preparation. After completing Jason Dion’s CySA+ training, it became clear that the certification felt like “Security++.” The exam emphasized analysis, prioritization, and judgment over memorization, pushing me to think like an analyst rather than a test-taker.

*This is the certification path I was intentionally working toward during this phase of my career.*

CySA+ significantly matured how I approached detection and threat analysis. It reinforced what should matter to a threat hunter or host-based analyst, especially when evaluating alerts across endpoints, logs, and network telemetry. The material helped sharpen my ability to connect multiple weak signals into a coherent assessment of malicious activity.

My motivation for CySA+ was preparation for CASP+ (now SecurityX). It acted as a bridge between foundational security knowledge and more senior-level decision-making. Instead of focusing on individual alerts, I learned to think in terms of risk, context, and response impact across an environment.

I passed the CySA+ exam on June 2, 2023 with a high score and felt more confident in my knowledge than with any certification before it. That confidence carried over into my personal work, pushing me to further experiment with Unraid, OPNsense firewalls, and hands-on defensive labs in my free time. CySA+ reinforced not just what I knew, but how I thought as a defender.
