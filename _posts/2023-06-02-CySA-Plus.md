When I started preparing for CompTIA CySA+, I quickly realized it was very similar to Security+, but with a stronger emphasis on analytical and operational aspects. The foundational concepts were familiar, but CySA+ required applying them in a way that reflected real-world defensive workflows rather than relying on theory alone.

I studied for about a month, reserving two weeks for focused review. After finishing [Jason Dion’s CySA+ training](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-cysa-003/?srsltid=AfmBOopjwLiBxcmeptLNSfvQ44c0mfHE_u2SNaKC81AhFfBxxmCUxIiJ), I recognized that the CySA+ exam expected me to analyze situations in cyber security and assess situations with a more skilled mindset. I looked over the [exam objectives](https://www.comptia.org/en-us/certifications/cybersecurity-analyst/). Diving deep into each section helps to understand what is included. When studying and going over the content I highly recommend to look over each and ask why this is important and look up definitions on everything you do not know. This difference meant I had to adapt my study by thinking as an actual analyst throughout the process.

*This is the certification path I was intentionally working toward during this phase of my career.*

CySA+ significantly increased how I approached detection and threat analysis. It reinforced what should matter to a threat hunter or host analyst, especially when evaluating alerts across endpoints, logs, and network telemetry. The material helped sharpen my ability to connect multiple weak alerts into identifying malicious activity.

My motivation for CySA+ was preparation for CASP+ (now SecurityX). It acted as a bridge between foundational security knowledge and more senior level decision making. Instead of focusing on individual alerts, I learned to think in terms of risk, context, and response impact across an environment to enhance my teams abilities and to lead them in the proper direction.

I passed the CySA+ exam on June 2, 2023 with a high score and felt more confident in my knowledge than with any certification before it. That confidence carried over into my personal work, pushing me to further experiment with Unraid, OPNsense firewalls, and hands-on defensive labs in my free time. CySA+ reinforced not just what I knew, but how I thought as a defender.
