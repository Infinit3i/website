# Cyber Nerd Discord Bot

The **Cyber Nerd Discord Bot** is an interactive cybersecurity learning bot designed to continuously challenge and educate users through daily questions, live updates, and automated intelligence drops.

It is built entirely in **JavaScript** and served as a major learning milestone for me. Through this project, I learned how to:
- Consume and normalize **RSS feeds**
- Pull data from multiple **news outlets**
- Schedule and **continuously push updates**
- Handle **edge cases**, failures, and malformed data gracefully

The bot creates a steady flow of cybersecurity knowledge while reinforcing consistency, automation, and reliability—core skills for detection engineering and security operations.
