# [Defensive Rules](https://github.com/Infinit3i/Defensive-Rules)

I wanted this to be a place where I could save my detection rules that were custom to better find what I didn't see of abundance.

**Defensive Rules** is a curated collection of Sigma detection rules authored by **Infinit3i**, with contributions and collaboration alongside **deej1721** and **B0und13ss**. The repository is organized by data source—including **Windows**, **Syslog**, and **Zeek** with the goal of providing defenders a centralized, modular library for building and deploying detections across multiple environments and SIEM platforms.

The primary objective of this project is clarity and reusability. Each rule is written to be easily understood, customized, and mapped to **MITRE ATT&CK**, enabling defenders to reason about coverage gaps and adversary behavior rather than treating detections as opaque alerts. The rules focus on high-signal attacker activity observed in real-world environments, rather than overly generic or noisy patterns.
