I completed Splunk Power User on January 28, 2026. The purpose was simple: it was a required step toward Splunk Administrator.

The course reinforced advanced use of SPL (Search Processing Language), including transforming data, building efficient searches, and understanding how searches interact with indexed data. The material focused on using Splunk effectively rather than managing the platform itself.

This was not taken for depth or specialization. It served as a gating requirement so I could move on to Splunk Admin and deeper platform-level responsibilities. Power User did what it was supposed to, it was merely a stepping stone for the admin path nothing more, nothing less.
