GCFA was the certification I spent the most time on and the one that helped me the most as a threat hunter and incident responder. More than any other exam, it changed how I approach investigations, host analysis, and attacker mindset. This is my favorite certification because of how directly it maps to real world defensive work.

The areas I focused on the most were Windows registry analysis, file system artifacts, system logging, and understanding where evidence actually lives on disk. Learning how artifacts are created, modified, and removed gave me a much stronger ability to reason about attacker activity rather than guessing. NTFS artifacts, registry hives, and event logs became primary data sources instead of afterthoughts.

I also spent a large amount of time studying persistence mechanisms and anti forensics techniques. Understanding how attackers hide, clean up, and survive reboots changed how I hunt. Instead of looking only for obvious signals, I learned to look for inconsistencies, gaps, and subtle traces that indicate tampering or long term presence.

This certification was extremely difficult for me. I devoted a full four months to GCFA and did not study anything else during that time. Both of my practice exams were failures, which forced me to reassess how I was studying. Near the end, I went into full overdrive and treated preparation like an investigation rather than a class.

During my GCFA preparation, I also discovered 13Cubed and the depth of knowledge he shares around digital forensics and incident response. His explanations helped reinforce many of the concepts I was struggling with, especially around Windows artifacts, memory analysis, and attacker behavior on hosts. I watched several of his videos, including content from his forensic analysis series, and they helped connect theory to practical investigation workflows in a way that complemented the GCFA material extremely well. His content became a valuable secondary reference when I needed another perspective to fully understand how and why artifacts existed where they did.

I watched all of the videos three times, similar to how I studied for CASP and SecurityX. I built a very deep index that tracked exactly what I was struggling with, organized by severity. Every weak area sent me back to specific video sections, book chapters, and labs. I reread the books multiple times and repeated labs until the workflow made sense without reference.

I passed GCFA on October 31, 2024. This certification sharpened my threat hunting mindset more than any other exam I have taken. It improved how I investigate incidents, validate hypotheses, and explain findings with confidence. GCFA did not just test knowledge. It forced me to earn it.
