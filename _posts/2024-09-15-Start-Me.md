[Start Me](https://start.me/p/qbzw4e/cyber-security)

I created this Start.me page to help my team in the Marine Corps. I wanted one place where people could learn and grow. This page is built to support IT, SOC analysts, incident response, penetration testing, red teaming, and malware analysis. I tried to cover as much as I could from each field.

Everything here is great material whether theory or practical. Tools, training resources, industry news, conferences, and career information are all organized so teams can actually use them. The goal is to make learning easier and remove friction for people trying to improve their skills.

This project reflects how I approach cyber security. Build strong fundamentals, share knowledge, and make resources accessible. If you want access, want to contribute, or have suggestions on how it should be organized better, let me know.
