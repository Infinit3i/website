I took the CompTIA Security+ exam two weeks after completing Network+ and passed on March 5, 2023. Unlike Network+, this certification required a mindset shift rather than a continuation of pure networking fundamentals. Going in, I knew Security+ would be heavier on terminology, abstract concepts, and how cybersecurity professionals communicate risk and intent. Conversations with coworkers confirmed that many people find Security+ easier after spending time in the field. I understood the challenge ahead and chose to meet it head on.

One of the biggest hurdles was the volume of acronyms used across cybersecurity domains. Many of the terms were unfamiliar at the time, so a large part of my preparation was focused on learning the language of the field. This directly aligned with Security+ objectives covering security architecture, operations, and governance.

I used [Jason Dion’s Security+ Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/securityplus/?srsltid=AfmBOorGT2atMGalP7xK-wZ1vXWiIRituiDyKm_V0TAWO8AzaRF6Em2l) course again, but this time I watched every video in full. His explanations helped translate abstract concepts into practical meaning and gave context to how security decisions are made in real environments. I also took all of the provided practice exams three times to reinforce retention and eliminate weak spots.

I approached this exam more cautiously because I didn’t yet feel fluent in how cybersecurity professionals framed problems and solutions. The repeated testing helped solidify that fluency, especially around domains like risk management, incident response, and security operations, which are core to the Security+ objectives.

Security+ was the certification that locked in foundational thinking for me. Concepts like risk transfer, mitigation, and avoidance, along with the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability), fundamentally changed how I approached daily cybersecurity decisions. I passed with a higher score, felt confident in discussions and meetings afterward, and walked away with knowledge I actively use.
