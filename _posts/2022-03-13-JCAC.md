I completed JCAC (Joint Cyber Analysis Course), a six-month NSA-hosted military schoolhouse focused on building a deep technical foundation in cybersecurity. This was not something you study for. It was a full-time pipeline designed to break weak fundamentals and force competence through repetition and pressure.

The course covered defensive cyber operations (DCO), offensive cyber operations (OCO), and the full OSI model from a practical, operational perspective. Networking fundamentals were drilled daily. Whether it was subnetting, routing, switching, and how data actually moves across networks. It was a constant adventure to learn every single day and swim to stay alive.

We worked hands-on with virtual routers, switches, VLANs, default gateways, and device roles. Understanding how systems interconnect, how traffic is segmented, and how failures propagate across layers was non-negotiable. OSI Layers 1–3 were emphasized heavily because that is where real troubleshooting starts.

My JCAC class began with 24 students and graduated 11. I finished with an 89% average. The attrition was intentional. The course demanded consistency, attention to detail, and the ability to think under pressure. I enjoyed the entire experience.
