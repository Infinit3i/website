Two months after earning Security+, I took the CompTIA Server+ exam and passed on May 5, 2023. My original plan was to pursue Linux+, but it was not supported by the program I was enrolled in at the time. Rather than delay progress, I pivoted to Server+, which ended up strengthening my understanding of enterprise infrastructure and data center operations.

Server+ helped me understand how servers are designed, deployed, and maintained in real-world environments. I focused heavily on understanding server racks, what components belong in them, and how everything fits together physically and logically. This included electrical requirements, power distribution, and how much power each server component should consume to remain stable and efficient.

A major emphasis was learning what is required to properly support a production server environment. This included firewalls, routers, switches, server blades, and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS). Understanding how these components work together reinforced concepts around availability, redundancy, and fault tolerance at the infrastructure level.

Unlike my previous certifications, I did not have a structured video course to rely on. Instead, I studied directly from the official Server+ exam objectives and built my own "course" by breaking down each objective and researching it independently. This forced me to truly understand each topic rather than passively consume content, and it significantly improved retention.

Server+ ended up being one of the certifications I felt most confident about. The self-driven study approach made the material click quickly, the exam felt fair, and I passed feeling very good about both the result and the depth of infrastructure knowledge I gained from the process.
