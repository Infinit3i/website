Two months after earning Security+, I took the CompTIA Server+ exam and passed on May 5, 2023. My original plan was to pursue Linux+, but it was not supported by the program I was enrolled in at the time. Instead of delaying, I pivoted to Server+, which ultimately strengthened my understanding of enterprise infrastructure in a way that directly complemented my previous certifications.

Server+ helped solidify how servers are designed, deployed, and maintained in real-world environments. I learned how server racks are structured, what components belong in each rack, and how everything fits together physically and logically. This included understanding electrical requirements, power distribution, and how much power each server component should consume to remain stable and efficient.

A major focus was learning what is required to properly support a server environment. This included firewalls, routers, switches, server blades, and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS). Seeing how these components work together reinforced concepts around availability, redundancy, and fault tolerance at the infrastructure level.

I used Jason Dion’s Server+ course for preparation and watched all of the videos in full. His explanations made hardware-heavy topics approachable and helped tie infrastructure concepts back to operational realities, such as capacity planning, uptime, and environmental controls.

Server+ ended up being one of the certifications I felt most confident about going into the exam. The material clicked quickly, the exam felt fair, and I passed feeling very good about both the result and the infrastructure knowledge I gained from the process.
