I completed the SSCP exam on January 10, 2024 as a deliberate step toward preparing for CISSP. The goal was not to learn new material, but to understand how ISC2 structures and frames its exams.

SSCP emphasized risk-based thinking, access control, network security, incident response, and operational security. The material itself was familiar, but the way questions were written mattered more than the content.

ISC2 exams test judgment and prioritization rather than technical execution. Many questions hinge on choosing the *best* answer in a realistic scenario, not the most technically detailed one.

Taking SSCP first allowed me to adjust to that mindset before attempting CISSP. It clarified how ISC2 evaluates understanding and helped calibrate how to approach future exams under their framework.

SSCP served its purpose as a strategic stepping stone rather than a milestone.
