I completed AZ-900 on August 18, 2023 to get familiar with cloud concepts, not to specialize in Azure.

The core takeaway was simple: cloud infrastructure is fundamentally the same as on-premise infrastructure. The difference is ownership and responsibility, not function. Every cloud provider offers the same building blocks—compute, storage, networking, identity—just under different names.

Whether it is Azure, AWS, or GCP, the concepts map cleanly. Virtual machines are still machines. Networks still route traffic. Identity still controls access. The cloud just shifts who owns and manages each layer.

From an operational perspective, cloud is someone else’s computer instead of one I run locally. That abstraction can help or hurt depending on whether you understand what is actually happening underneath.

AZ-900 served its purpose by reinforcing that cloud fundamentals are transferable. Once you understand the underlying systems, the provider-specific terminology becomes secondary.
